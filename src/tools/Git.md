# Git

Git is used to maintain source code. When working with -for example- robot programs in plain text this is an ideal method of keeping track of changes. Next to that, using Git enables working together on the same project/files/documentation.

**_NOTE:_**  Git is not suitable for binary files.

Read up on installation and configuration:
- [Installing GIT](https://git-scm.com/download/win)
- [Basic GIT configuration](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup)

After installing Git for windows, open Powershell or another console and setup your credentials.
```
git config --global user.name "John Doe"
git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com
```
