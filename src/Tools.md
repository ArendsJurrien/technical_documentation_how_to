# Tools

To get started, you'll need to install Visual Studio Code, GIT, Docker and mdBook. We'll use Windows executables. You're free to use development setups and whatnot, but you're on your own when things do not work.

- [Git](./tools/Git.md)
- [Docker](./tools/Docker.md)
- [PlantUML server](./tools/PlantUMLserver.md)
- [Visual Studio Code](./tools/VSCode.md)
